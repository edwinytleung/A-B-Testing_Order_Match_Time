# A/B Testing (Order Match Time)

We would like to test the impact of a change introduced at ‘2017-03-30 12:00:00 AM’ on our Order Allocation system. The objective of the change is to improve order Match Time, which is the duration since the time an order was created to the time the order was accepted by a driver. The file response_data.csv contains the order records you’d need for this part of the challenge.

Feel free to derive your answers to the following questions using any techniques and softwares of your choice:

a) What is the resulting impact from this change?

b) Any additional insights or observations you think are worth noting?

c) Any observations regarding the testing process or environment? How would you improve or redesign this experiment?

Your answer will be evaluated based on the following aspects (you can provide your answers in any form you like):
- Your thought process and how you get to your results
- Your visualization and statistical knowledge
- Your presentation and delivery of results
